For this assignment, we want you to watch how many times you're using <div> tags. Whenever you have one element within a division, it means you don't need that division! For example, imagine you had a code like this

By looking at the code above, can you identify unnecessary divisions? We hope so! Again, whenever you have one element inside a division, it means that's redundant! Think about how you can refactor the code above to make it simpler. One possible way to refactor the code is to do something like below

We hope you get the point.  Putting only one element in another element is like putting your Christmas gift in a box and then putting that box in another box that's slightly bigger (which means that the outer box was not necessary).

Great programmers always do things with less code, and we want you to practice reviewing your code and always striving to do things in the most simple manner possible. Fewer lines of code -- less text -- this is always better. Please remember that.



It's recommended that you reset and normalize the CSS attributes before you add your own CSS attributes.
Download the cropped images to be used for this exercise.
Make sure you've validated your HTML and that you're not using any float: left or right.
Make sure you double checked your code for any redundant use of ids or classes. Make sure you don't have any single element within a division. 
Refactor your HTML code, if necessary.
